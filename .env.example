# Default values are optimized for production to avoid having to configure
# much in production.
#
# However it should be easy to get going in development too. If you see an

# overwritten in development to make your life easier.

# In development avoid writing out bytecode to __pycache__ directories.

# In development with Docker Desktop / Linux the default value should work.
# If you have Docker running in a custom VM, put the VM's IP here instead.
#
# In production you'll want to set this to your domain name or whatever you
# plan to access in your browser, such as example.com.
#export SERVER_NAME=localhost:8000

# How many workers and threads should your app use? WEB_CONCURRENCY defaults
# to the server's CPU count * 2. That is a good starting point. In development
# it's a good idea to use 1 to avoid race conditions when debugging.

# What healthcheck test command do you want to run? In development, having it

# What ip:port should be published back to the Docker host for the app server?
# If you're using Docker Toolbox or a custom VM you can't use 127.0.0.1. This
# is being overwritten in dev to be compatible with more dev environments.
#
# If you have a port conflict because something else is using 8000 then you
# can either stop that process or change this 8000 to be something else.

# Use the default in production to avoid having gunicorn directly accessible to
# the internet since it'll very likely be behind nginx or a load balancer.
